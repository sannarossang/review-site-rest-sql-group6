## Intro ❗

This project is a database-based project that uses SQLite and Express. Our project is the backend part of a tailor review site! 

## Installation 🖥️
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    ```bash

    ```
2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

3. Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory by running the following command:
    ```bash

4. Open the project in your code editor that has a terminal feature.
5. In the terminal, run the following command to install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file:
